# Project-ICAD
The project is being developed as a prototype to enhance security features in high end cars. The Car security can be increased if we are able to implement image processing features along with prebuilt instrumentation cluster. Once a person enters the car, a camera module is brought up near the face of the person, once the face is recognized successfully, the system intimates the controller that the owner has been recognized and finally activates the instrumentation cluster. Else if a person other than the owner tries to enter, the system fails to recognize the face leading to a buzzer being activated and eventually no cluster activation i.e. the car would not start if anyone tries to take unauthorized access into the car.
